# ParalogGrouper

Current version: 1.0.1 (November 2022)

### Purpose

ToDo


#### Original Yang and Smith orthology inference manuscript, documentation and scripts


ParalogGrouper makes use of the **paralogy resolution** (also described as **orthology inference**) approaches described and implemented by Yang and Smith 2014 [here][1]. These approaches have since been adapted for target capture datasets as described in the bioRxiv manuscript [here][2]. The original documentation and scripts can be found [here][3].
